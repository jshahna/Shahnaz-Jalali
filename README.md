This project involved analyzing Dinosaur Fossil Record Data from the [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/#/). I leveraged Python, utilizing libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset. I handled missing data, generated visualizations, and analyzed trends over time to extract meaningful insights. My analysis focused on exploring dinosaur diversity, identifying the prevalence of specific types, determining the largest-bodied species, and evaluating a hypothesis regarding the evolutionary increase in dinosaur size.

In this project, I analyzed a dataset of Hollywood films sourced from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) as part of a DataCamp competition. Using SQL for exploratory data analysis (EDA), I answered key stakeholder questions regarding the diversity of films in the dataset, including examining movies from specific countries and languages.
