This project involved analyzing Dinosaur Fossil Record Data from the [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/#/). I leveraged Python, utilizing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset. I handled missing data, generated visualizations, and analyzed trends over time to extract meaningful insights. My analysis focused on exploring dinosaur diversity, identifying the prevalence of specific types, determining the largest-bodied species, and evaluating a hypothesis regarding the evolutionary increase in dinosaur size.


## [Project 1: Predict the Price of a House in King County](https://github.com/jshahna/King-County-House-Prices/blob/main/Group_Final_Project_CharryDeandres_KanizSyeda_ShahnazJalali.pdf)
This project is the culmination of my Certificate program at the University of Washington, completed in collaboration with two fellow students. The primary objective was to develop machine learning algorithms and build predictive models to estimate house prices in King County. We focused on identifying the key features influencing house prices and selecting the best-fitting regression model for accurate predictions.
